# Multi-class-Student-Grade-prediction

Created a multi-class machine learning model for predicting student grades using previous semester grades and marks.

challenges faced during the project:

1.as marks are categorized into grades example O, A, B, C, F.This grades gave imbalance nature in dataset,it made a difficulty to predict the grade.

2.And lack of accuracy given by machine learning models.

Algorithms used in this project:

1.Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique SMOTE Algorithm- for removing imbalance nature in dataset

2.Multi-class model includes:

i.Support Vector Machine(SVM)

ii.Naive Bayes(NB)

iii.k-nearst neighbour(KNN)

iv.Logistic Regression(LR)

v. Decision Tree(DT)

vi. Random Forest(RT)


Step 1: removing imbalance nature in dataset using SMOTE Algorithm.

Step 2: Building a multi-class model using machine learning models

Atlast, among all of the above models Random Forest gave highest accuracy 95% comparing to other models
